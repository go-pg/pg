# Maintenance mode

go-pg is in a maintenance mode and only critical issues are addressed. New development happens in
[**Bun**](https://bun.uptrace.dev/guide/pg-migration.html) repo which offers similar functionality
but works with PostgreSQL, MySQL, and SQLite.

# Changelog

## v10.10.7

- Fixed race condition in notify listener.
- Add shortcut `WhereInOr`.
- Fixed bug in sending cancel request to terminate long running query.

## v10.10.6

- Updated OpenTelemetry to v1.0.0.

## v10.10

- Removed extra OpenTelemetry spans from go-pg core. Now go-pg instrumentation only adds a single
  span with a SQL query (instead of 4 spans). There are multiple reasons behind this decision:

  - Traces become smaller and less noisy.
  - [Bun](https://github.com/uptrace/bun) can't support the same level of instrumentation and it is
    nice to keep projects synced.
  - It may be costly to process those 3 extra spans for each query.

  Eventually we hope to replace the information that we no longer collect with OpenTelemetry
  Metrics.

## v10.9

- To make updating easier, extra modules now have the same version as go-pg does. That means that
  you need to update your imports:

```
github.com/go-pg/pg/extra/pgdebug -> github.com/go-pg/pg/extra/pgdebug/v10
github.com/go-pg/pg/extra/pgotel -> github.com/go-pg/pg/extra/pgotel/v10
github.com/go-pg/pg/extra/pgsegment -> github.com/go-pg/pg/extra/pgsegment/v10
```

- Exported `pg.Query` which should be used instead of `orm.Query`.
- Added `pg.DBI` which is a DB interface implemented by `pg.DB` and `pg.Tx`.

## v10

### Resources

- Docs at https://pg.uptrace.dev/ powered by [mkdocs](https://github.com/squidfunk/mkdocs-material).
- [RealWorld example application](https://github.com/uptrace/go-realworld-example-app).
- [Discord](https://discord.gg/rWtp5Aj).

### Features

- `Select`, `Insert`, and `Update` support `map[string]interface{}`. `Select` also supports
  `[]map[string]interface{}`.

```go
var mm []map[string]interface{}
err := db.Model((*User)(nil)).Limit(10).Select(&mm)
```

- Columns that start with `_` are ignored if there is no destination field.
- Optional [faster json encoding](https://github.com/go-pg/pgext).
- Added [pgext.OpenTelemetryHook](https://github.com/go-pg/pgext) that adds
  [OpenTelemetry instrumentation](https://pg.uptrace.dev/tracing/).
- Added [pgext.DebugHook](https://github.com/go-pg/pgext) that logs failed queries.
- Added `db.Ping` to check if database is healthy.

### Changes

- ORM relations are reworked and now require `rel` tag option (but existing code will continue
  working until v11). Supported options:
  - `pg:"rel:has-one"` - has one relation.
  - `pg:"rel:belongs-to"` - belongs to relation.
  - `pg:"rel:has-many"` - has many relation.
  - `pg:"many2many:book_genres"` - many to many relation.
- Changed `pg.QueryHook` to return temp byte slice to reduce memory usage.
- `,msgpack` struct tag marshals data in MessagePack format using
  https://github.com/vmihailenco/msgpack
- Empty slices and maps are no longer marshaled as `NULL`. Nil slices and maps are still marshaled
  as `NULL`.
- Changed `UpdateNotZero` to include zero fields with `pg:",use_zero"` tag. Consider using
  `Model(*map[string]interface{})` for inserts and updates.
- `joinFK` is deprecated in favor of `join_fk`.
- `partitionBy` is deprecated in favor of `partition_by`.
- ORM shortcuts are removed:
  - `db.Select(model)` becomes `db.Model(model).WherePK().Select()`.
  - `db.Insert(model)` becomes `db.Model(model).Insert()`.
  - `db.Update(model)` becomes `db.Model(model).WherePK().Update()`.
  - `db.Delete(model)` becomes `db.Model(model).WherePK().Delete()`.
- Deprecated types and funcs are removed.
- `WhereStruct` is removed.

## v9

- `pg:",notnull"` is reworked. Now it means SQL `NOT NULL` constraint and nothing more.
- Added `pg:",use_zero"` to prevent go-pg from converting Go zero values to SQL `NULL`.
- UpdateNotNull is renamed to UpdateNotZero. As previously it omits zero Go values, but it does not
  take in account if field is nullable or not.
- ORM supports DistinctOn.
- Hooks accept and return context.
- Client respects Context.Deadline when setting net.Conn deadline.
- Client listens on Context.Done while waiting for a connection from the pool and returns an error
  when context is cancelled.
- `Query.Column` does not accept relation name any more. Use `Query.Relation` instead which returns
  an error if relation does not exist.
- urlvalues package is removed in favor of https://github.com/go-pg/urlstruct. You can also use
  struct based filters via `Query.WhereStruct`.
- `NewModel` and `AddModel` methods of `HooklessModel` interface were renamed to `NextColumnScanner`
  and `AddColumnScanner` respectively.
- `types.F` and `pg.F` are deprecated in favor of `pg.Ident`.
- `types.Q` is deprecated in favor of `pg.Safe`.
- `pg.Q` is deprecated in favor of `pg.SafeQuery`.
- `TableName` field is deprecated in favor of `tableName`.
- Always use `pg:"..."` struct field tag instead of `sql:"..."`.
- `pg:",override"` is deprecated in favor of `pg:",inherit"`.

## v8

- Added `QueryContext`, `ExecContext`, and `ModelContext` which accept `context.Context`. Queries
  are cancelled when context is cancelled.
- Model hooks are changed to accept `context.Context` as first argument.
- Fixed array and hstore parsers to handle multiple single quotes (#1235).

## v7

- DB.OnQueryProcessed is replaced with DB.AddQueryHook.
- Added WhereStruct.
- orm.Pager is moved to urlvalues.Pager. Pager.FromURLValues returns an error if page or limit
  params can't be parsed.

## v6.16

- Read buffer is re-worked. Default read buffer is increased to 65kb.

## v6.15

- Added Options.MinIdleConns.
- Options.MaxAge renamed to Options.MaxConnAge.
- PoolStats.FreeConns is renamed to PoolStats.IdleConns.
- New hook BeforeSelectQuery.
- `,override` is renamed to `,inherit`.
- Dialer.KeepAlive is set to 5 minutes by default.
- Added support "scram-sha-256" authentication.

## v6.14

- Fields ignored with `sql:"-"` tag are no longer considered by ORM relation detector.

## v6.12

- `Insert`, `Update`, and `Delete` can return `pg.ErrNoRows` and `pg.ErrMultiRows` when `Returning`
  is used and model expects single row.

## v6.11

- `db.Model(&strct).Update()` and `db.Model(&strct).Delete()` no longer adds WHERE condition based
  on primary key when there are no conditions. Instead you should use `db.Update(&strct)` or
  `db.Model(&strct).WherePK().Update()`.

## v6.10

- `?Columns` is renamed to `?TableColumns`. `?Columns` is changed to produce column names without
  table alias.

## v6.9

- `pg:"fk"` tag now accepts SQL names instead of Go names, e.g. `pg:"fk:ParentId"` becomes
  `pg:"fk:parent_id"`. Old code should continue working in most cases, but it is strongly advised to
  start using new convention.
- uint and uint64 SQL type is changed from decimal to bigint according to the lesser of two evils
  principle. Use `sql:"type:decimal"` to get old behavior.

## v6.8

- `CreateTable` no longer adds ON DELETE hook by default. To get old behavior users should add
  `sql:"on_delete:CASCADE"` tag on foreign key field.

## v6

- `types.Result` is renamed to `orm.Result`.
- Added `OnQueryProcessed` event that can be used to log / report queries timing. Query logger is
  removed.
- `orm.URLValues` is renamed to `orm.URLFilters`. It no longer adds ORDER clause.
- `orm.Pager` is renamed to `orm.Pagination`.
- Support for net.IP and net.IPNet.
- Support for context.Context.
- Bulk/multi updates.
- Query.WhereGroup for enclosing conditions in parentheses.

## v5

- All fields are nullable by default. `,null` tag is replaced with `,notnull`.
- `Result.Affected` renamed to `Result.RowsAffected`.
- Added `Result.RowsReturned`.
- `Create` renamed to `Insert`, `BeforeCreate` to `BeforeInsert`, `AfterCreate` to `AfterInsert`.
- Indexed placeholders support, e.g. `db.Exec("SELECT ?0 + ?0", 1)`.
- Named placeholders are evaluated when query is executed.
- Added Update and Delete hooks.
- Order reworked to quote column names. OrderExpr added to bypass Order quoting restrictions.
- Group reworked to quote column names. GroupExpr added to bypass Group quoting restrictions.

## v4

- `Options.Host` and `Options.Port` merged into `Options.Addr`.
- Added `Options.MaxRetries`. Now queries are not retried by default.
- `LoadInto` renamed to `Scan`, `ColumnLoader` renamed to `ColumnScanner`, LoadColumn renamed to
  ScanColumn, `NewRecord() interface{}` changed to `NewModel() ColumnScanner`,
  `AppendQuery(dst []byte) []byte` changed to `AppendValue(dst []byte, quote bool) ([]byte, error)`.
- Structs, maps and slices are marshalled to JSON by default.
- Added support for scanning slices, .e.g. scanning `[]int`.
- Added object relational mapping.
